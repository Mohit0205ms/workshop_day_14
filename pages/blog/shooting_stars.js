                In the midst of a climate crisis and overtourism, all roads point towards a way of travel that is more sustainable, meaningful and inclusive.
                I try to make conscious choices to support local communities and minimize my environmental impact. Not just because it’s the need of the hour, but also because it’s a more immersive way to travel.
                "An adventurous life does not necessarily mean climbing mountains, swimming with sharks, or jumping off cliffs. It means risking yourself by leaving a little piece of you behind in all those you meet along the way."
                "I always wondered why somebody doesn’t do something about that. Then I realized I was somebody."
                "Instead of wondering when your next vacation is, maybe you should set up a life you don't need to escape from."
                The thing about solo travel is, you can never feel 100% ready. There will always be a tiny voice at the back of your head asking, "Are you crazy?"
